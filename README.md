# **Introduction**
In this challenge, we were asked to complete a climate analysis for a vacation to Hawaii, using pything an SQLAlchemy. We were tasked to analyze the last 12 months of precipitation data in the dataset, as well as a temperature analysis for the station with the hgihest observations.

# **Files** 

In the folder *SurfsUp* you will find the completed challenge files:
* *climate_FINAL.ipynb* - this is my jupyter notebook with my python/sqlalchemy code to run the analysis as well as plotting the results for precipitation.
* *app_FINAL.py* - this is my Python script for the Climate App API
* *Resources* - in this forlder you will find the sqlite and/or csv files needed to run analysis.
* *Output* - in this folder you will find all image outputs from the code
